			The wireless home automation voice recognition system is an integrated

			This system is portable and constructed in a way that is easy to install, 
			configure, run and maintain. Voice is used in this project for 
			controlling of operations because it is easily produced by humans. 
			It increases productivity. It helps people who have trouble using their hands, 
			people who have cognitive disabilities. It has long-term benefits for students. <br><br>
			The power to control mains, appliances, doors, water supply, safes has been made
